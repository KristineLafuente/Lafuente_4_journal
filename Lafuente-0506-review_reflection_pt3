67 is the y coordinate, and 43 is the x coordinate. 

	if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888");
If i is equal to zero, 8888 will print 8's all around the @ symbol; the .
s will be replaced with 8's.

	System.out.print(map[i][j]);
x and y coordinates are printed throughout the map.

	system.out.println(".");
When x is printed, "." will be printed all around the x. This is different than #e because this prints a single line, while #e prints everywhere within the array.

	System.out.println(map[i][j]);
this prints the map if there is nothing else in the map. Only periods will print/

Static has a single intsance. We use static so that we don't have to call a method, variable, ect. when using it throughout the code. 

Objects can be used in our game to create x and y coordinates. Here is the code:
public static int positionx = 15;
public static int positiony = 8;
