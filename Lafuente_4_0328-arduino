	I have not made any code adaptations yet, but changing the pattern of the way the light flickers. For the lights on the circuit to work, the positive and negative wires are essential. The circuit must also be connected to the computer with an hdmi cord. Programs are shared with arduino through the hdmi cord. We used the programs given to us on a website. These programs were used to make the lights on the circuit follow patterns made in the code. My partner and I have completed about eight projects last week. Each project requires us to upload a new porgram to the computer from Arduino IDE. How many wires, lights, buttons, ect. also change when starting a new project. One project we completed made the light on the board become dim and then bright again. Another project we completed made the light blink. One project let us turn the light on and off using a button. All of these programs were different, and we learned what different parts on the circuit were used for. We were also able to experience code in a different way. When completeing my own project, I would like to adapt the simon says code.
