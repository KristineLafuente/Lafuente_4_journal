I did not explain getters and setters. I also did not create a class constructor. The essay part of the test was not as strong as I wanted it to be. To be more successful, I needed to do research instead of just relying on notes. Instead of memorizing cs terms, I have to understand how the terms work; I have to be able to explain the terms without a problem.
