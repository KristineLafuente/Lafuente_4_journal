	The main similarity I noticed between assembly and HRM is the usage of conditional and unconditional jumps; both languages use conditional instructions to repeat/ re-execute steps. One difference I noticed is the way to add comments. In assembly, to add a comment, you have to have a semicolon before typying a comment. While in HRM, you have to drag your comment and click it to write a comment. These two languages have very similar syntax, but there are stil a few differences.
