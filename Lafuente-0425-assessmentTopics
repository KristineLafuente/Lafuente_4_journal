	On the end of the year assessment, I beleive we will cover the difference between low-level and high-level programs. A few other things I think we will cover include debugging, object-oriented programming, problem solving, and explaining what example code means. I think most of the test will be built around Java, and how Java works. I also believe there will be questions based on algorithim optimization or how to simplify code to make it easier to read or run.
