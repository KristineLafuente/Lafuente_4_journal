Arrays are used for making a objects. The code for an int array is int[] i = new int[2] The code for a String array would be String[] computer = {"Keyboard", "Mouse", "Screen"}; The code for a boolean array would be boolean[] i = new boolean {true, false}; an example for a double array would be double[] i = new boolean [size]; You could change the first value of the in array to 42 by changing the number in the square brackets to 42. To change the first value of a String array to Bob, you change the second word in quotations to Bob. You would change the second one to Bob because the order starts from 0 and goes to 1, 2, 3, ect. The code: private String[] dessert = new String[3] creates an empty array. The code: private String[] postres = {"rice pudding", "pan dulce", "bunuelos"} creates an array with three values. They are different because the first one is an Arraylist, and the second one is an array. To replace bunuelos with apple pie, you change what is inside the quotations.
