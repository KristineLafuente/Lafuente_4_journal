	Casting is labeling an object differently; casting does not change the
object itself. When you upcast, the object is being used as the label. When
downcasting, the object's properties are not hidden anymore.

		 Cod c = new Cod();
		 Fish f = c; //upcasting
		 
		 Cod c1 = new Cod();
		 Fish f = c1;
		 Cod c2 = (Cod) f; //downcasting

	
	Converting char to String:
		 String worms = Character.toString(char fish);

	The range of values for byte is -128 to 127.
