	If we were to continue with arduino, I would create a guessing game. You would get 3 trys, and the numbers will range from 1-10. 
You would have to hit the button a certain number of times to represent the number you are thinking of. If the number of times you hit
doesn't match the number the program is set at, then the buzzer and red light will "buzz". If it is right, the green light will buzz.
