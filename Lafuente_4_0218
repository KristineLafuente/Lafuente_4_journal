The code given makes the player change postions each time you move. It is unrealistic/ unproductive to memorize Slick syntax because we want to learn how to code in java. An array has a list of objects. An array list is within the array, and the array list can change the size of objects. An example an an array would be: String[] dogShow = {"Great Dane", "Beagle", "Boxer"}; An example of an arraylist would be: for(int i = 0;i < dogShow.length -1; i++){ The difference between an array and an arraylist is that you can change the size of an object in an arraylist. We could make a health counter for an avatar by making an array and arraylist. The array could have different things that hurt the avatar, and the arraylist could tell how much health is being taken away from the avatar.
