Assembly is a programming language; it is a low-level language. Assemly is good for converting source code to machine language. By converting the code to machine lanuage, the code becomes readable by the computer. Machine language is also low-level. Assembly and Java are different because assembly is low-level, and Java is high-level. High-level languages are easier to read, and low-level languages are much more specific. High-level languages are human readable while low-level languages refer to morse code. Since Java is a high-level language, it is much easier to read, and has less details to pay attention to because it helps usfix errors easier. Assembly is low-level, therfore it is harder to read and requires more attention to detail.
