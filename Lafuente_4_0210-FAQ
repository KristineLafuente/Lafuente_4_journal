The first problem I faced when adding orbs to my game is fixing errors I had when typing new code. The second problem I have is making my game run. I have most of the code for the orb, but I have errors. A third problem I have is making the orb follow where the player goes. I don't have ten specific problems, but my main problems are cleaning my code up and making the orb move where the player faces.
