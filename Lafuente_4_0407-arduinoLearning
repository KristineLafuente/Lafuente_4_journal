	Arduino is very different from netbeans; I like the hands on aspect of it. Two things I have learned from using Arduino are how to make different sounds at specific times and how to match a blinking light with the sounds. In this project, for making specific hertz of sounds match letters in code was something I learned to do easily. I foud this easy since I play violin and we used sheet music to make it easier to transfer note sounds into letters in the code. The specific probelm my partner and I have is adding multiple lights for each note. Although we have not added mutiple lights, we did learn how to add one light.After we added a light, code was added to make the light blink for every note released.
