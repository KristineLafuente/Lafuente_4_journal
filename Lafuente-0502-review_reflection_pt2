	An array is a list that contains one datatype.

	A simple array of Strings: String[] dog = {"Pug", "Boxer", "Poodle", "Grey Hound"}
	This creates an array of four values. 

	A 2-D array uses char to make a map. 
	char[][] map = new char[16][30]; this creates a map with 16 rows and 30 columns.
	We use two integers to be used as points on the map.
	
	A 3-D array uses three integers rather than using two like in a 2-D array.

	While loops use boolean to see if something is true or false. If it is true, then the program will loop. 

	While loops can be used in our game to create random maps after one is completed. If the game is completed (true) then the game will randomly
	create a new map.

	To call a method in main, you have to call it using the same thing you refer to in the method; you have to use the same interface.

	It is important to use .toLowerCase() with your Scanner input to allow lower case and upper case
	letters acceptable.

	You should use different methods when moving the protagonist and to check for intersections so that an x can print properly.
